# Visual Rosary — Progress Log

Running log of where we are, so any session can pick up quickly. Newest first.
For architecture/infra details see the README and `src/` — this file is just the
"what's done / what's next" narrative.

## Current state (2026-08-13)

Feature-complete and deployed on Vercel (`dockinhmancoi.com`). Working tree clean.
Bilingual (VI/EN) visual Rosary: pick a mystery set on the landing page, then step
through the full sequence one prayer per screen with a bead rail, per-bead public-
domain artwork, scripture verses, and a settings panel.

### Recently completed
- Downloadable **QR poster** in the Share modal.
- Anonymous **"Rosaries Prayed Today" counter** via Supabase — hidden until the
  day's total exceeds 10; gated by a `prayer_counter` feature flag; fail-open so a
  stats outage never breaks the app.
- **"How to pray" rosary diagram** on the landing page that responds to the
  VI/EN/both language toggle.
- Closing prayers consolidated onto one screen; Return Home moved into settings.
- Verse citations fixed; footer bar with Vietnamese book abbreviations.
- Prayer-modal sizing so long prayers fit without scrolling.

### Possible next steps (not yet decided)
- Ideas / bugs to be added here as they come up.
